This file contains real raw survey data collected from 600-700 data professionals via LinkedIn, Twitter, and other platforms by Alex the Analyst.

Data Fields:
Job Titles: Participants selected or provided their job titles (e.g., data analyst, engineer, architect).
Yearly Salary: Includes salary data that requires cleaning (e.g., ranges, 'k' for thousands).
Work Preferences: Responses on job satisfaction, including salary, work-life balance, co-workers, management, and career growth.
Demographics: Information on gender, country of origin, and age range (via a sliding scale).


-Data Transformations: The data was cleaned and transformed directly in Power BI, not in Excel, to prepare it for analysis and visualization.
-Power BI Dashboard: I created an interactive dashboard in Power BI that visualizes key insights from the dataset, such as salary trends, job satisfaction, and industry distribution.


This project demonstrates the process of transforming raw data into meaningful visualizations using Power BI, providing a comprehensive view of the survey results.
